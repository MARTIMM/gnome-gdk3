<p>Do not confuse these events with the signals that GTK+ widgets emit. Although many of these events result in corresponding signals being emitted, the events are often transformed or filtered along the way.</p>
<p>In some language bindings, the values GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS would translate into something syntactically invalid (eg Gdk.EventType.2ButtonPress, where a symbol is not allowed to start with a number). In that case, the aliases GDK_DOUBLE_BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_TRIPLE_BUTTON_PRESS can be used instead.</p>

<h2 id="class_GdkEventButton"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">class GdkEventButton</a></h2>
<p>Used for mouse button press and button release events. The type will be one of GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS or GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE,</p>
<p>Double and triple-clicks result in a sequence of events being received. For double-clicks the order of events will be: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.</p>
<p>Note that the first click is received just like a normal button press, while the second click results in a GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS being received just after the GDK_BUTTON_PRESS.</p>
<p>Triple-clicks are very similar to double-clicks, except that GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS is inserted after the third click. The order of the events is: GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS and GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE.</p>
<p>For a double click to occur, the second button press must occur within 1/4 of a second of the first. For a triple click to occur, the third button press must also occur within 1/2 second of the first button press.</p>
<p>To handle e.g. a triple mouse button presses, all events can be ignored except GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS</p>

<li><p>Num $.x_root: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Num $.y_root: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GdkEventExpose"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">GdkEventExpose</a></h2>
<p>Generated when all or part of a window becomes visible and needs to be redrawn.</p>
<ul><li><p>UInt $.type: the type of the event (GDK_EXPOSE or GDK_DAMAGE).</p>
</li>
<li><p>N-GObject $.window: the window which received the event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UInt $.send_event: 1 if the event was sent explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GdkRectangle $.area: bounding box of @egion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pointer $.region: the region that needs to be redrawn. A region is of type <code>cairo_region_t</code> and represents a set of integer-aligned rectangles. It allows set-theoretical operations like cairo_region_union() and cairo_region_intersect() to be performed on them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p>Int $.count: the number of contiguous GDK_EXPOSE events following this one. The only use for this is “exposure compression”, i.e. handling all contiguous GDK_EXPOSE events in one go, though GDK performs some exposure compression so this is not normally needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GdkEventCrossing"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">GdkEventCrossing</a></h2>
<p>Generated when the pointer enters or leaves a window.</p>
<ul><li><p>UInt $.type: the type of the event (GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY or GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY).</p>
</li>
<li><p>N-GObject $.window: the window which received the event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UInt $.send_event: 1 if the event was sent explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>N-GObject $.subwindow: the window that was entered or left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UInt $.time: the time of the event in milliseconds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Num $.x: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Num $.y: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Num $.x_root: the x coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Num $.y_root: the y coordinate of the pointer relative to the root of the screen.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GdkCrossingMode $.mode: the crossing mode (GDK_CROSSING_NORMAL, GDK_CROSSING_GRAB, GDK_CROSSING_UNGRAB, GDK_CROSSING_GTK_GRAB, GDK_CROSSING_GTK_UNGRAB or GDK_CROSSING_STATE_CHANGED). GDK_CROSSING_GTK_GRAB, GDK_CROSSING_GTK_UNGRAB, GDK_CROSSING_STATE_CHANGED were added in 2.14 and are always synthesized, never native.</p>
</li>
<li><p>GdkNotifyType $.detail: the kind of crossing that happened (GDK_NOTIFY_INFERIOR, GDK_NOTIFY_ANCESTOR, GDK_NOTIFY_VIRTUAL, GDK_NOTIFY_NONLINEAR or GDK_NOTIFY_NONLINEAR_VIRTUAL).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.focus: 1 if window is the focus window or an inferior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UInt $.state: (type GdkModifierType): a bit-mask representing the state of the modifier keys (e.g. Control, Shift and Alt) and the pointer buttons. See GdkModifierType.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GdkEventFocus"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">GdkEventFocus</a></h2>
<p>Describes a change of keyboard focus.</p>
<ul><li><p>UInt $.type: the type of the event (GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE).</p>
</li>
<li><p>N-GObject $.window: the window which received the event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>UInt $.send_event: %TRUE if the event was sent explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.in: 1 if the window has gained the keyboard focus, 0 if it has lost the focus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GdkEventConfigure"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">GdkEventConfigure</a></h2>
<p>Generated when a window size or position has changed.</p>
<ul><li><p>GdkEventType $.type: the type of the event (GDK_CONFIGURE).</p>
</li>
<li><p>N-GObject $.window: the window which received the event.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.send_event: 1 if the event was sent explicitly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.x: the new x coordinate of the window, relative to its parent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.y: the new y coordinate of the window, relative to its parent.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.width: the new width of the window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Int $.height: the new height of the window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="GdkEvent"><a class="u" href="#___top" title="go to top of document">GdkEvent</a></h2>
<p>The event structures contain data specific to each type of event in GDK. The type is a union of all structures explained above.</p>
